### **Genshin AHH: The Card Game**

**Core Concept:** A strategic deck-building RPG where you collect, build, and battle with digital cards representing the characters, weapons, and artifacts of Teyvat. The game moves beyond simple turn-based actions to a deep system of stat management, resource farming, and RNG-driven character customization, mirroring the core experience of Genshin Impact.

### **1. The Character Cards: Living Blueprints**

Character Cards are the heart of your account, not just your deck. They are persistent entities that you level up over time.

*   **Core Stats:** Each Character Card has a full suite of stats that directly influence combat:
    *   **HP (Health Points):** Now in the thousands (e.g., a Level 90 Zhongli card might have 15,000 HP).
    *   **ATK (Attack):** The base value used for calculating damage from Normal Attacks, Skills, and Bursts.
    *   **DEF (Defense):** Reduces incoming damage by a percentage based on the attacker's level and the attack's power.
*   **Sub-Stats (The RNG Core):**
    *   **CRIT Chance %:** The percentage chance for an attack to be a Critical Hit.
    *   **CRIT DMG %:** The damage multiplier applied when a Critical Hit occurs (e.g., +150% damage).
    *   **Elemental Mastery (EM):** Directly increases the damage of Elemental Reactions like Vaporize, Melt, and Overload.
    *   **Energy Recharge %:** Increases the amount of Energy gained from using skills and taking damage, allowing for more frequent Elemental Bursts.

### **2. Acquisition & Progression: The Gacha RPG Loop**

Your collection grows through a system familiar to any Genshin player, with daily limitations to encourage consistent play.

*   **Wishing (Gacha System):**
    *   **Character & Weapon Banners:** You spend "Acquaint Fate" and "Intertwined Fate" cards to "Wish" on banners. This is the primary way to obtain new 4-star and 5-star Character and Weapon cards.
    *   **Pity System:** A guaranteed 5-star card is granted after a certain number of wishes, just like in the main game.
    * **The Characters and weapons**: obtained by wishes are permanent, You Breed different cards to create new cards to use them in battle and trade them.
    
*   **Farming & Leveling Up:**
    *   **Domains(Dungeons):** To level up a character card from 1 to 90, you must challenge "Domain" game modes. These are PvE battles that cost a daily-refreshing resource (let's call it "Card Resin") to claim rewards.
    *   **Rewards:** Domains drop Character EXP cards, Mora (the currency for leveling), and Ascension Materials (like Hurricane Seeds or Everflame Seeds) needed to break through level caps (20, 40, 50, etc.).
*   **Constellations:** Obtaining a duplicate of a Character Card grants a "Stella Fortuna," which can be used to unlock one of their six Constellations, providing powerful passive upgrades to their skills.

### **3. Customization: The Artifact System**

This is where the true "build" diversity comes from, directly translating Genshin's infamous artifact grind.

*   **The Artifact Grimoire:** Instead of equipping five separate cards, each Character Card has an "Artifact Grimoire" with 3 slots: Ring, Goblet, and Circlet.
*   **Farming Artifacts:** You spend Card Resin in high-level Domains to earn "Sealed Artifacts." When you open one, it reveals a random artifact for a random slot from that Domain's possible sets (e.g., a "Viridescent Venerer" Goblet).
*   **The RNG:** Each artifact has a **main stat** and up to four **sub-stats**, which are randomly assigned and upgraded. This creates the "grind" as you hunt for the perfect piece with CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG, and ATK% for your DPS characters.
*   **Set Bonuses:** Equipping 2 or 4 artifacts from the same set (e.g., "Crimson Witch of Flames") into the Grimoire activates powerful set bonuses.

### **4. Gameplay: How a Match Plays Out**

Matches would feel like a highly tactical and calculated version of a Genshin Impact fight.

*   **Resource System:** The Elemental Dice system can still be the core resource for taking actions each turn.
*   **Damage Calculation:** When you use a skill, the damage isn't a fixed number. The game calculates it on the fly:
    1.  **Base Damage:** `(Your Character's Total ATK * Skill's Damage Multiplier%)`
    2.  **Damage Reduction:** This is then reduced by the opponent's DEF.
    3.  **CRIT Check:** The game performs a "dice roll" against your CRIT Rate. If successful, the damage is multiplied by your CRIT DMG.
    4.  **Elemental Reaction Bonus:** If the attack triggers an Elemental Reaction (e.g., Hydro on a Pyro-afflicted target for Vaporize), the final damage is multiplied again, with the strength of the multiplier scaling with your Elemental Mastery.
*   **The Flow of Combat:**
    *   You still have a deck of "Tactic Cards" (representing food, potions, and event cards), but the main focus is on your three active Character Cards.
    *   You'd spend dice to use a skill, switch characters, or play a Tactic Card.
    *   Managing energy for your Elemental Burst becomes critical, making Energy Recharge a vital stat for support characters. Setting up the perfect, high-damage Elemental Burst, amplified by crits and reactions, would be the ultimate goal of a turn.
